(// C8-32, SYM

	C8-32 are 8-32 bit words that make up the elements of 8-32 bit strings. They should only be used in the context of strings, and never as a representation of a single character, to keep the semantics clean.

	SYM is used to represent a full unicode codepoint, i.e., a single character.
